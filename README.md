- Go to the Release page and download ``KeepInMindVITAsteam.zip``.
- Extract it.
- Put the game's folder(```..\steamapps\common\Keep In Mind```) inside the extracted folder(Should be Steam version).)
- Launch ``ApplyPatch.bat`` and wait(Will need from 15 to 25 minutes depending on the system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ``KeepInMindVITA_Files.zip``.
- Open the VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file(Not the ZIP file itself, just files inside it) over to ``ux0:app/KPMN12352/`(Picture Below of how it should look after copying everything).
